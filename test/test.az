this is a function definition with a comment on top:
:: 'map' a -> b [a]    => [b]
         f      (a:as) = f a : map f as
         f      []     = []

... and a type
co :> '[' a ']' = '[]'
             | a ':' [a]

this is how a typeclass could look like:
:? Functor f =
   :: 'fmap' a -> b f(a) => f(b)
   :: a '<$' f(b) => f(a)
